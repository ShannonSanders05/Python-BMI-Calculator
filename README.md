## Project Title: Python-BMI-Calculator

**Description**:

In this Python project, I created a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. The BMI calculator is designed to take user input, including height and weight, and then computes the BMI based on the provided values. The project encompasses:

1. **User Input Handling**: Incorporated user-friendly input prompts to collect necessary information such as height and weight.
2. **BMI Calculation**: Implemented the BMI formula to calculate the Body Mass Index using the user's input.
3. **Output Display**: Provided clear and concise output, presenting the calculated BMI to the user.

Special thanks to Alex the Analyst for his mentorship and guidance.
